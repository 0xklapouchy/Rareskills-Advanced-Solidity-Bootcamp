## ERC777 and ERC1363

#### Problem with ERC20

In `ERC20`, after a `transfer` or `approve`, there is no way to trigger code on the receiving or spending contract automatically. Users must wait for the first transaction to complete, then manually send a second transaction to perform actions executing business logic.

#### ERC777

`ERC777` improves `ERC20` by introducing more flexible token handling and removing the need for `approve` and `transferFrom` functions. 

It allows for `hooks`, enabling contracts to react to token transfers, similar to ETH transfers.

##### Problems with ERC777:

- `Reentrancy attack risk`: The `hooks` system can expose contracts to `reentrancy` vulnerabilities if not properly managed, potentially allowing attackers to exploit token transfers.
  
#### ERC1363

`ERC1363` is an extension of the `ERC20` standard that introduces callback functionality, which triggers code on recipient or spender contracts immediately after transfers or approvals.

##### Key functions:

1. `transferAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall`: After transferring tokens, these functions automatically call `onTransferReceived` on the recipient contract (an ERC1363Receiver).
2. `approveAndCall`: After approving a spender, this function calls `onApprovalReceived` on the spender contract (an ERC1363Spender).

This reduces the risk of token loss or locking by ensuring the receiving contract can handle the tokens properly. ERC1363 is especially useful for use cases like payments that need a callback after token operations.

#### Conclusion

Both standards aim to make token transactions more intuitive, but `ERC777` requires careful security management due to its hook functionality that was added directly to `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. 

The `ERC1363` standard is an improved version and a natural evolution of the `ERC20` standard, and should be preferred over `ERC777`.
